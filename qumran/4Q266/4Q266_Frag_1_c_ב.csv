Once the older PAM iamges are consulted (PAM 41664_10; 42392_8; and 43278_50), it is easier to read the mem. PAM 43278_50 is also important for the ink of sign_10 seems more consistent with a heh, than with a tav. In this case, syntax is changed and it is not in construct. Baumgarten reads, אשמתם. I am not sure where he sees the ink for mem of the plural suffix. RECHECK "
