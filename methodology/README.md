### Description

While it is feasible to create a web based front-end to facilitate the process of transcription, it is equally possible to use existing software, as is the case here. The reason we use existing software is because there is currently no workspace available to accomplish our work. Thus, the excel notebook is used for three reasons:

1. The cost to engineer a web-based front-end is not trivial;
2. There is currently no possible way to accomplish this work within the Scripta Qumranica workspace (so-called VRE);
3. The Excel file ensures data accuracy at several levels, thus enforcing best philological practices; and
4. Processing data in an Excel format is extensively supported in languages such as Perl, Python, Swift, and JavaScript.

The following palaeographical model facilitates a careful analysis of ancient fragments, either lapidary and/or non-lapidary and in whatever language.

### Annotation of Signs

To accumulate a database of signs, it is necessary to first begin by annotating an image with regions of interest. Let's first analyse what is meant by signs. A sign is any semantic bearing mark made on an image of a fragment ([Tucker and Porzig, 2018](bibliography/README.md)).
